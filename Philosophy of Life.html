<p> <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>In June 2024, after finishing my 6th semester of B.Tech Aerospace <br/>Engineering, in my summer holidays, I have decided to take some time to plan <br/>my career path. And before I started planning, I thought of revising all the <br/>philosophy that I know, wishing that would help.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>At that time, I thought philosophy means the entirety of knowledge, <br/>which has answers to all the questions. I&#8217;ve imagined myself standing before <br/>the great tree of knowledge and asking it &#8216;what should I do?&#8217;, instead of asking <br/>&#8216;I want to do this, and how can I achieve it?&#8217;. But the fact is, I am the one who <br/>has to gain the knowledge to answer my question and I have started searching <br/>for the answer.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>Without reading any books, without asking anyone, only by thinking and <br/>reasoning I have tried to gain knowledge and answer my question. All that I had <br/>with me was those little philosophical ideas I have thought of earlier, my <br/>aerospace engineering knowledge which I had a little understanding of, the <br/>knowledge attained from reading and listening the cultural education books and <br/>classes with utmost shraddha, the Chaganti Bhagavad-Gita pravachanas which I <br/>have listened a half, adiparva the Chaganti Ramayana which I have read a half <br/>and the Chaganti Kunti charitra pravachanas which I have listened for the <br/>Mahabharata assignment. These are the sources of knowledge that I have at that <br/>moment to manan and answer my question. So, many concepts in this work are <br/>based on Indian philosophy and my attempt is to reason them out and <br/>understand them to answer my question.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>Philosophy of Life <br/><b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>0. The Map of all Knowledge <br/> <br/></b>Question: If we can imagine all of the knowledge that we could know, how <br/></p>
<p>would that look like? How much &#8216;can&#8217; we know, leaving aside whether we have <br/>the ability to know it or not. <br/></p>
<p> <br/>To answer this question, think fundamentally of how we attain knowledge. <br/></p>
<p>Knowledge is &#8216;factual information&#8217;. Only the information that is true, that <br/>which really happened, happens or will happen is knowledge. We humans, <br/>attain knowledge fundamentally through our 5 senses: vision, hearing, smell, <br/>taste and touch. Imagine a 3D map, lying on a table, showing all of the places <br/>on the earth. Imagine a blue aura spread across all over this map. Whatever it <br/>touches, we will have the knowledge of the 5 senses there, and the aura is <br/>touching all the map. So, imagine if we have the information of these 5 senses <br/>of all the places in the universe. We know how everything looks, sounds, smells, <br/>tastes and touches across space and time. We know the past, present and future. <br/>If one has this knowledge, then can we say, he has all the knowledge?  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>The answer is no. He just has the sensory information; he didn&#8217;t process it. If <br/></p>
<p>you ask him why things fall only downward, he may have seen many things <br/>falling down, but doesn&#8217;t know the reason why? Turns out, we have a sixth <br/>sense called the &#8216;intellect&#8217;, which processes the sensory information, basically <br/>observes &#8216;patterns&#8217; in it, and creates more knowledge from given knowledge.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Example: A newly born child observes his mother daily. The first day he sees <br/></p>
<p>a blue giant coming to him and feeding food. The second day it is a yellow <br/>giant. It is just her mother changing her saree every day. He observes patterns &#8211; <br/>what is changing and what is not changing. Only the face of her mother and her <br/>voice is consistently not changing whenever he gets food. So, through pattern <br/>recognition of his sensory information, he identifies his mother.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Now the mother in the above example, is not just a sensory object, it is a <br/></p>
<p>pattern observed. I call it a high-grade object. High grade knowledge is knowing <br/>truths about high grade objects, like knowing her mother is so many years old. <br/>Some examples of high-grade objects are: season, year, death, concepts like <br/>dharma, gravity, magnetism. These objects cannot be seen, heard, smelled, </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>tasted or touched, but are patterns observed from them, their consequences can <br/>only be sensed.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>High grade knowledge can only be derived only when something changes, <br/></p>
<p>something remains consistent, so that we can observe patterns.  <br/></p>
<p>&#8220;All knowledge is patterns deduced from patterns deduced from patterns <br/>deduced from &#8230; sensory information&#8221; <br/></p>
<p>Example: Newton observes an apple falling down. All of the objects on earth <br/>falls down, but looking at the sky, he sees the astronomical objects like sun and <br/>moon, won&#8217;t fall down. Now, because gravity is changing from place to place, <br/>decreasing as we go out of earth, we can observe it.  <br/></p>
<p> &#8220;<i>Only things that change can be observed</i>&#8221; <br/></p>
<p>Example: From the observed truths: &#8216;apple falls down&#8217;, &#8216;sun doesn&#8217;t fall <br/>down&#8217; and from many other truths, newton deduced patterns and observed the <br/>truth &#8216;gravity acts on all objects that has mass and decreases with the distance <br/>between them&#8217;. And this truth is not changing anywhere, it is always true not <br/>matter what the object is.  <br/></p>
<p>In the above example, the truth that &#8216;gravity acts&#8217; is a high-grade truth <br/>than &#8216;apple falls&#8217; or &#8216;sun doesn&#8217;t fall&#8217;, because it is deduced from these truths <br/>from pattern recognition and also the low-grade truths can be explained as the <br/>consequence of the high-grade truth being true: because gravity acts, the apple <br/>falls down. Knowing a single high-grade truth is so much valuable than <br/>knowing numerous low-grade truths. If a person comes and asks whether <br/>objects will fall down on mars or not, we need not go mars and test to find the <br/>low-grade truth that &#8216;objects will fall on mars too&#8217;, we can just predict that with <br/>our high-grade truth that &#8216;gravity acts when there is mass&#8217; and mars has mass <br/>like earth. So, the numerous low-grade truths can be reasoned and found out <br/>from a single high-grade truth.  <br/></p>
<p>Now, imagine the blue aura on the map piling upwards to form a <br/>narrowed down pyramid, like a sky scraper. The increasing grade of knowledge <br/>through pattern recognition is represented by this pyramid. High grade <br/>knowledge will rest on the top of the pyramid, having sensory information as its <br/>base. To climb up the pyramid we need to deduce patterns from patterns from <br/>patterns&#8230; When we ask why a certain truth is true, &#8220;why does an apple fall but <br/>the sun doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; we climb up the pyramid by observing patterns. And we find <br/>the high-grade truth that &#8216;gravity acts&#8217; and when we climb down the pyramid, <br/>we are applying this to predict the low-grade truths.  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>Now, the question is what lies on the top of this pyramid. What is the <br/>highest-grade knowledge? Well, whenever we run out of observing more <br/>patterns, whenever we see nothing is changing between two observations and <br/>everything is consistent, we cannot deduce anything more from it. And these are <br/>what I call &#8216;Eternal truths&#8217;. They won&#8217;t change, and so we don&#8217;t know why they <br/>are true, but we just know that they are true.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: &#8216;Two magnets of opposite poles attract each other&#8217; is an eternal <br/>truth. We don&#8217;t know why they attract like that. Because we didn&#8217;t find that this <br/>statement being false in any case. If they fail to attract in any case, for example <br/>if the temperature is raised, we may reason out why they attract. But that truth is <br/>never becoming false for us to observe patterns.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: If you ask why apple falls down, we can say because gravity <br/>acts on objects with mass. But if you ask why does gravity acts on objects with <br/>mass, we don&#8217;t know. And we call it the &#8216;Law&#8217; of gravitation.  <br/></p>
<p>The laws of physics are some examples of eternal truths. Physics only <br/>talks about the non-living nature. There any many other fields of knowledge <br/>which talk about different aspects of nature, like biology talking about objects <br/>with life, social sciences talking about societal truths, and all these sciences <br/>have eternal truths that are not known why they are true.  <br/></p>
<p>Now, if our hypothetical man who has all the sensory information, does <br/>all the pattern recognition possible and reach the eternal truths in every domain, <br/>can we say he has all the knowledge? The answer is still no. There is some <br/>knowledge that cannot be obtained from senses. It is what is called, spirituality.  <br/></p>
<p>Spiritual knowledge is something which I haven&#8217;t experienced anything <br/>of. I can only talk about it based on the description given by people who have <br/>experienced it. Because spiritual knowledge is not obtained through the senses, <br/>it should be placed completely away from the pyramid as a separate entity. A <br/>different map for it maybe. <br/></p>
<p> Imagine if the world is completely in red colour. Every object and person <br/>are completely only in red colour. Then, in this red world, can anyone identify <br/>that everything is in red colour. They couldn&#8217;t because they haven&#8217;t seen any <br/>other colour, to even know what a colour is. Something that is not changing <br/>cannot be observed by senses and pattern recognition as described earlier. But, <br/>if that person in that red world is able to see that red colour, is able to <br/>experience what is common everywhere in everything, then that is spirituality. <br/>In our world if we could experience that spirit which is common everywhere in <br/>everything, then that is spiritualty. Considering this perspective, we could place </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>the spiritual knowledge as the top most peak of the sensory knowledge pyramid, <br/>as it is the highest-grade object that will never change across space and time. <br/>But due to the fact that it cannot be observed by senses and even through pattern <br/>recognition of them, I am placing it separately.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/> <br/></p>
<p>In the map of all knowledge as described, whenever a person tries to <br/>climb up the pyramid, trying to reach the eternal truths and explain the bottom <br/>ones as the consequence of the eternal truths we say that he is doing <br/>&#8216;philosophy&#8217;. Philosophy is when we try to break the habit of living on the low-<br/>grade truths and try to reason them out from fundamental knowledge (eternal <br/>truths) or even trying to extend the fundamental knowledge deeper. This <br/>document discusses the philosophy of life. Philosophy of life takes the centre <br/>place in the map of all knowledge. <br/></p>
<p>The primary reason man got the ability to reason out and attain knowledge is to <br/>live his life better, better than the primitive creatures. Philosophy of life is the <br/>knowledge of life itself; the aim is to explain why the life is the way it is. All <br/>other knowledge is what man uses to achieve his goals of life, but the <br/>philosophy of life talks about these goals of life that the man is trying to <br/>achieve, reasons out why he is trying to achieve those goals, what happens if he <br/>achieves them. And by understanding this knowledge, a man can set the right <br/>goals in life for which he may use all other knowledge to achieve them. Such <br/>knowledge is often given by religion and not by science, as science doesn&#8217;t <br/>include the spiritual dimension, without which the philosophy of life is <br/>incomplete.  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p><b>1. Sensible Philosophy of Life <br/> <br/></b></p>
<p>The question that I have to search answer for is &#8220;What should I do?&#8221;. So, I <br/>have started to understand why do people do the things that they do.   <br/></p>
<p>Example: A worker yells at his boss, when asked why did he yell. he says <br/>due to anger, when asked why anger. he says the boss didn&#8217;t give his salary, <br/>when asked why he wants salary, he says to live, when asked why live? There <br/>was no answer.  <br/></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The ultimate goal of any living being is to live</i>&#8221;. This is the eternal truth of <br/>the sensible philosophy of life. When asked why is it the ultimate goal, we don&#8217;t <br/>know the answer for it, we just say it is the nature of a living being. But we can <br/>say because living itself has been the ultimate goal, the living being existed till <br/>now, if not, it wouldn&#8217;t have been existed. If we asked why we do the things we <br/>do, we would ultimately end up at the answer, &#8216;to live&#8217;, one way or the other.  <br/></p>
<p> We can deduce any activity that living beings do from this fundamental <br/>truth that living is its ultimate goal. Reasoning from that fundamental truth to <br/>explain the small small activities that living beings do requires us to understand <br/>some more concepts, they are the emotions and the <i>purushardhas.</i> Explaining in <br/>this order, I will go from primitive living beings: the animals, to the superior <br/>living being: the human.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>Animals <br/></b></p>
<p>Animals are those living beings which are struck in their &#8216;swabhaavam&#8217; <br/>(their nature). They will do whatever their natural tendencies urge them to do <br/>for. Those natural tendencies are always directed towards the goal of making the <br/>creature to live.  Those natural tendencies are what we call as &#8216;emotions&#8217;.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: When seen food, tendency is to eat, it will eat and live. <br/></p>
<p>When another animal snatches the food, the emotion is anger, tendency is to <br/>fight, it will fight, snatch back, eat and live.  <br/></p>
<p>When seen its predator, the emotion is fear, tendency is to run away, it will run <br/>away and live.  <br/></p>
<p>When seen its opposite gender, the emotion is lust, tendency is to mate, it will <br/>mate and the living will continue in a new body before the old body is gone.  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>In this way all the emotions, and the tendencies due to these emotions are <br/>developed in animals to make them live. If a certain tendency is to make it die, <br/>then the creature would have been extinct and wouldn&#8217;t have been existed.  <br/></p>
<p>This way, even the small small activitiesgod  that animals do can be <br/>explained from the eternal truth that &#8216;the goal of their action is to live&#8217;. So, if <br/>asked why an animal does what it does, it can be answered that: because it has <br/>got a tendency to do that thing, and if asked why does it got such tendency, we <br/>end up at the eternal truth: &#8216;to live&#8217;, which cannot be answered if asked why.   <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>Humans <br/></b></p>
<p>Out of all the living beings the only being that can live against and above <br/>its swabhaavam and natural tendencies is human. Because he does the things <br/>not only because of his natural tendencies, but also due to his experiential <br/>tendencies, he can live better than any other creature.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: A specific kind of fly thinks that light in the night is a food <br/>source. Because that was the case in the forest, they have survived. But now in <br/>the urban environment, that is not the case. Their natural tendencies make them <br/>to think that the tube lights are their food. And they would dwell there the whole <br/>night and die of hunger before the sunrise. They cannot live against their natural <br/>tendencies even if they are going to die. It takes some random fly in the group <br/>to have the tendency no to do so and the kids of this fly will survive in the <br/>future by increasing their population in accordance with the Darwin&#8217;s theory: <br/>survival of the fittest.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: Human on the other hand, if he sees an unknown fruit, <br/>delicious to see, eats it and falls sick. He is never going to eat the fruit again <br/>even if his natural tendencies show him the fruit to be delicious. The next time <br/>he sees the fruit he remembers of his past experience of eating it and falling <br/>sick, and he has the control over his natural tendencies to follow his experiential <br/>tendency.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Both animals and humans have this experiential tendency, but the <br/></p>
<p>proportion to which they do things on what basis varies as shown in the </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>diagram. Humans adapt based on their life experiences, and animals evolve <br/>through Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution, which takes many generations.  <br/></p>
<p>A human need not adapt on his experiences, but can also adapt by seeing <br/>others, like the middle-aged people seeing the older people dying of diabetes <br/>and avoiding their natural tendencies to eat sweet.  <br/></p>
<p> Now, due to the quality of learning through experience and passing this <br/>knowledge to future generations, humans achieve their goal of living, very <br/>easily. So easily that we see living to just live as a very trivial goal and we set <br/>higher goals to not just live, but to live better. We set higher goals, but <br/>ultimately even those higher goals also correspond to life itself.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: A natural tendency of humans is to gather resources so that they will <br/>be useful in tough situations. A man can set his goal to earn say some 50 lakhs <br/>of money through trading in a year for his future uses, while controlling his <br/>natural tendencies to enjoy life. But even while controlling his natural <br/>tendencies of life for a greater goal, that greater goal still corresponds to his <br/>natural tendency of gathering resources.  <br/></p>
<p> So, humans can control some natural tendencies of life, to achieve those <br/>tendencies which also correspond to life itself, but they can select which one to <br/>control and which one to achieve. Question: If all the goals of human ultimately <br/>correspond to life, why do some people suicide.   <br/></p>
<p> Example: The same person who tried to earn 50 lakhs through trading, if <br/>goes into 50 lakhs debt, will get the emotion of fear. The tendency which <br/>corresponds to fear is to run away from the source of fear. He sees only way he <br/>can runaway peacefully is to die. Humans also have the natural tendency to fear <br/>for death, but he chooses to control his natural tendency of fear for death while <br/>achieving his other natural tendency to run away from society by suicide.  <br/></p>
<p> Hence, if humans can choose their natural tendencies of life which can <br/>even make them die, then we can very well say that they can also choose some <br/>natural tendencies which cannot make their life better, but worse. And they <br/>often set them as long-term career goals. <br/></p>
<p>Example:  Terrorist children live a very hard life and would even sacrifice <br/>their life for their goal of killing people. They were told that they would reach <br/>heaven if they do so, and enjoy after life there.  <br/></p>
<p> Improper goals can make the living worse. And sometimes these <br/>improper goals will only be understood that they are improper when we <br/>experience their consequences. And then we develop experiential tendencies to </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>not to do them again. So, it is always a clever option to listen to the already <br/>experienced ones about the proper goals of life. Better if they are spiritually <br/>experienced too, so that a terrorist cannot confuse you talking about the <br/>afterlife. The proper goals of life given by the most experienced ones in the <br/>Indian philosophy are the purushardhas.  <br/></p>
<p> &#8216;Living better&#8217; is when we maximize the lifetime of that life we want to <br/>live when we are living it and minimize the time of that life we don&#8217;t want to <br/>live when we are living it.   <br/></p>
<p> Example: A student can either choose to live 15 minutes of life he doesn&#8217;t <br/>want to live and do his painstaking assignment. Or he can take that kneel down <br/>punishment the next day and live an hour of life that he doesn&#8217;t want to live. <br/>When he chooses the first option, we say, he is living a &#8216;better life&#8217;.  <br/></p>
<p> When a human sets the purushardhas as the goals of his life, he will live <br/>his best life possible. The purushardhas have to be pursued simultaneously, <br/>where one goal aligns with the other and not like one after the other.  <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>Purushardhas <br/></b></p>
<p><b>Kama:</b> Kamic activities are defined as those which will give pleasure when <br/>done, like enjoying arts like movies and music for example. Here I am defining <br/>kamic activities as those when you do just what your natural tendency prompts <br/>you to do, and not control it. Yelling at someone and hurting them when in <br/>anger is also a kamic activity in this regard. The distinctive feature of Kama is <br/>that it is a very temporary and momentary goal and not a long-term goal like the <br/>other three. Kama is primitive but important goal in life because most of our <br/>natural tendencies themselves are tuned to make our life live better, like in the <br/>case of animals.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Artha:</b> Ants build their anthills. Birds build their nests. A squirrel reserves food <br/>for winters. This way animals collect resources for survival. They don&#8217;t do these <br/>activities with the aim of living better in the future, but because doing these <br/>activities is their natural tendency, they do it. And these natural tendencies are <br/>tuned such that they bring resources for their survival, without them knowing it. <br/>When human observes this trend that, collecting resources leads to a &#8216;better <br/>life&#8217;, and consciously sets a goal to collect resources then that goal is Artha. <br/>This pursuit of resource is an experiential tendency of a human.   <br/></p>
<p>Humans are social beings and live in societies and civilizations. In a <br/>sociological perspective, when living in a society, a human doesn&#8217;t try to gather </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>all the resources by himself. An individual will gather any one resource, and for <br/>sharing it to others, he will demand money, and with that money he will buy all <br/>other resources that he needs, collected by others. If he wants to use more <br/>resources collected by the community, then he has to earn more resource that <br/>the community needs. This way, the concept of money, automatically regulates <br/>the proper sharing of resources among a community. This explains why one <br/>pursues money, instead of directly setting the goal as to earn resources. Earning <br/>money is earning resources.  <br/></p>
<p>By this collective resource sharing system, humans share resources properly and <br/>&#8216;live better&#8217;.   <br/></p>
<p><b>Dharma</b>: The living entity is a cyclic ecosystem where one living being <br/>depends on the other for survival, in direct and indirect ways.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: plants are consumed by herbivore animals, which are consumed by <br/>carnivores, which are consumed by decomposers to give nutrients required for <br/>plants.  <br/></p>
<p>All the living beings in the above example have some role to play such <br/>that the &#8216;living entity&#8217; lives. If there are no decomposers, then due to <br/>malnutrition plants will die and animals have no food, so they will die too and <br/>the whole living entity dies. So, animals are naturally tended to do somethings <br/>such that the living entity exists as a whole. Like the herbivores naturally <br/>tending to eat only plants, carnivores tending to eat on them and so on. Again, <br/>they don&#8217;t set the goal to protect the living entity they are living in, but they are <br/>naturally tended to do it.  <br/></p>
<p>Humans, who can live out of their natural tendencies, when consciously <br/>set the goal to do actions that aligns with the survival of the living entity, that <br/>goal is called &#8216;Dharma&#8217;. Because his ultimate goal is to live and due to the fact <br/>that he cannot live as an independent entity, and he can live only if the living <br/>entity lives, his actions should align to the goal of making the living entity to <br/>live.   <br/></p>
<p>In between an individual and the living entity comes a human society. In <br/>a human society, every individual takes up a different role for the society to live <br/>as a whole and together. Varnashrama dharma describes the different types of <br/>roles that are necessary for a society to live. The same way the living creatures <br/>doing certain tasks is necessary for a cyclic living ecosystem to survive as <br/>described earlier, humans doing certain tasks in necessary for a human society <br/>to survive, like workers gathering resources while soldiers protecting them and <br/>rulers managing the governance.  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>When an individual in a society lives such that the society lives, we say <br/>he is a living in accordance to &#8216;law&#8217;. And when the individual and the societal <br/>goals are such that the living entity lives, we say they are living in accordance to <br/>dharma. Morality, that is what is right and wrong in a society are decided in <br/>accordance to achieve the sustenance of the society (the aim of law). Dharma <br/>and Adharma are decided in accordance to achieve the sustenance of life itself. <br/>What is dharma is not decided by a human, but can only be identified by him.  <br/></p>
<p>Example:  If in a society, murdering is justified, then in that society <br/>people would kill themselves and the society would destroy, and had destroyed <br/>and only those societies where murdering is not justified remained <br/></p>
<p>If in our society if a person becomes selfish and does things that are not <br/>inclined to the law, which is inclined to dharma, the destruction wouldn&#8217;t crawl <br/>up to the point where the person destroys the society and the whole living entity <br/>and, in the end, because he is dependent on them, he dies. The society would try <br/>to stop him before he proceeds for complete destruction. And if he wins the <br/>society, and destroys it then the living entity would try to stop him to a very <br/>little extent and after that there will be a complete destruction and he will get <br/>destroyed and a new living entity will start to begin with new societies which <br/>will evolve again.  <br/></p>
<p>Example: If Ravana wins the battle.  <br/></p>
<p>Doubt: The truth that has been portrayed without giving any reasoning is that <br/>&#8216;the side of dharma always wins in the end&#8217;. That side which is towards the <br/>sustenance of the society and living entity always wins. Which can be reasoned <br/>out to some extent by saying, only if that is true, the living entity is still alive <br/>today. But I am not able to reason out why that is true. Saying &#8216;dharma always <br/>wins in the end&#8217; is the same as saying &#8216;the living entity would always survive <br/>forever&#8217;. Why would that be true? Why would a human, who now even has the <br/>power to destroy all the living entity with nuclear weapons, would fail to do so <br/>if tried? Or maybe it is an eternal truth that cannot be reasoned out, because the <br/>side of dharma simply keeps winning in the end, like two magnets always keep <br/>attracting each other, not changing for us to observe patterns from it by <br/>observing when it wins and when it doesn&#8217;t.  <br/></p>
<p>However, due the fact that the living entity and the society are necessary for <br/>an individual to live and to live better, it is one of the proper goals of human to <br/>do actions that would lead to the sustenance and not the destruction of the <br/>society and the living entity. And this goal is the goal to adhere to Dharma.  <br/></p>

<p><b>2. In-Sensible Philosophy of Life (Spirituality) <br/></b></p>
<p>The in-sensible philosophy of life cannot be reasoned from the knowledge <br/>acquired by the senses. And hence can only be given by the spiritually <br/>experienced people and believed by the others to be true. The problem with <br/>spiritual knowledge is that, to know that if it is true or not, one has to first <br/>believe it is true and try to get the spiritual experience and only then he can <br/>know whether if it is true or not. So, it is like &#8216;believe it to see and not see it to <br/>believe&#8221;. Regardless of the spiritual knowledge being true or not, it is logically <br/>structured in itself, where one truth can be explained as a logical consequence of <br/>the other. Like a fictional story, which may not be real but has logics in itself. <br/>The aim of this section is to present my understanding of the spiritual <br/>knowledge described, and to also to present a plausible hypothesis of why <br/>spirituality could be true.  <br/></p>
<p>Spirit is a supernatural entity that is present everywhere and hence cannot be <br/>observable by senses, or say always observed, hence not identified. And when <br/>one identifies this oneness in everything, he is in the spiritual dimension.  Spirit <br/>is present in all of the nature, including non-living objects. In the same way that <br/>the eternal truth for sensible philosophy of life is &#8216;the ultimate goal of a living <br/>beings is to live&#8217;, the eternal truth for the in-sensible philosophy of life is that <br/>&#8216;the ultimate goal of the spirit is to liberate from the nature&#8217;. The difference is <br/>that the first truth is reasoned and the second one is just accepted and believed <br/>to be true.    <br/></p>
<p>Until now, all of the three goals that have been described always <br/>corresponded to the fundamental truth that &#8216;the ultimate goal of a living being is <br/>to live&#8217;. But the strangest part of spirituality is that it says the fourth goal proper <br/>goal of human is &#8216;Moksham&#8217;, and it is to liberate oneself from living. It doesn&#8217;t <br/>feel counter-intuitive if you think that living is the goal of human (a natural <br/>entity) and liberation is the goal of the spirit (a supernatural entity). <br/></p>
<p> <br/>A plausible hypothesis on why spirituality could be true:  <br/></p>
<p> A non-living thing, take stone, behaves precisely according to its nature <br/>(swabhaavam), if hit enough hard, breaks, if given enough temperature, melts, it <br/>will not and cannot behave against its natural behaviour, and its behaviour is <br/>completely predictable. An animal is a slightly elevated being, which still <br/>behaves according to its nature (swabhaavam), if scared, runs, if angry, fights, <br/>but has the slightest control of its natural tendencies, and when adapted enough <br/>can behave different in the same situation, and its behaviour can be mostly </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>predicted. But a different human behaves completely different for the same <br/>situation, as an individual behaviour is mostly dependent on his experiences but <br/>not his nature (swabhaavam) and natural tendencies that arise due to them.  <br/></p>
<p> The trend is that nature (shrushti) is evolving from living according to its <br/>swabhaavam to living against it or beyond it. When this goal is completely <br/>achieved, and a part of the nature realizes the spirit, then the spiritual goal of <br/>moksha is accomplished by that part of the nature and it is liberated from the <br/>nature (shrushti).   <br/></p>
<p>Karma Yogam &#8211; A path to spirituality <br/></p>
<p> There are four paths that are described to reach the spiritual dimension. <br/>Since my question is &#8220;what should I do?&#8221; and is related to &#8216;doing&#8217;, action, I <br/>have tried to understand Karma yoga out of the four.  Karma philosophy not <br/>only describes the path to reach the fourth goal, moksha, but since also the other <br/>three purushardhas are goals, and you have to do action to reach them, the <br/>karma philosophy explains and predicts the consequences of action and hence <br/>we can reach a complete understanding required to answer the question &#8216;what <br/>should I &#8216;<i>do</i>&#8217;?&#8217;.  <br/></p>
<p> According to the karma principle, some activities lead to spiritual <br/>progress called good karma, and some activities lead to spiritual decline called <br/>bad karma. And when there is enough spiritual progress one attains moksha. <br/>Whether an activity leads to good karma or bad karma is dependent on the <br/>intention while doing it and not on the action at all. And when the intention <br/>while doing the action is selfless, then it is good karma and when the intention <br/>is self-centric then it is bad karma.  <br/></p>
<p> Example: The acts of seva, daana, patriotism are all examples of selfless <br/>actions which are done not for the benefit of oneself, but for the benefit of <br/>society and nature. Like when a soldier sacrifices his life for his country and <br/>when a woman stands in front of a tree that is going to be cut.   <br/></p>
<p> A plausible hypothesis is that when a man evolves from doing an action <br/>for himself, to doing an action for his family, to doing an action for the people <br/>he know, to doing it for his country, to doing it for this entire nature that he is <br/>part of, and by doing so he sees that &#8216;himself&#8217; all over the nature, that oneness <br/>between him and the nature, then he has experienced the spirit, and attained <br/>moksha.  <br/></p>
<p>The way our intention of doing an activity brings the consequences our life can <br/>be reasoned out to some extent by understanding the following quote. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become <br/>your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, <br/>they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny</i>&#8221; <br/></p>
<p>Hence an intention, which is just a thought once can grow into an action one <br/>day, and the consequence of that action will be the fruit of that intention. <br/></p>
<p>Example: If a manager yells at an employee for a mistake, with a cruel <br/>intention of seeing him suffer rather than to correct his behaviour, then such <br/>cruel intentions of making people suffer will grow and one day will make him <br/>to physically hurt his employee and beat him to death when no one is around, <br/>for another mistake he has done. For which he loses his job and maybe goes to <br/>jail and suffers.  <br/></p>
<p>In the example, the seed of his suffering lies in his self-centric intention <br/>of satisfying his cruelty. Which hased grown in his actions day by day and made <br/>him to suffer due to the result of such actions. Karma works in this way, but not <br/>such that: because the manager hurts someone today with cruelty, someone will <br/>hurt him one day with cruelty, or in his next life he will be born as the same <br/>employee he is hurting now or something of that sort.  <br/></p>
<p>But, this reasoning of karma growing from though to deed cannot explain why <br/>the accumulated karma would transfer to the next life. And it is another eternal <br/>truth in the philosophy of life which is not known why it is true.   <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>Connection between Karma and Dharma:  <br/></p>
<p> Question: How are the consequences of the actions we do affect our life.  <br/></p>
<p>The consequences of our action affect us back in two ways, one is due to the <br/>intention and one is due to the activity that is done. Karma explains the <br/>consequences due our intention and dharma explains the consequences due to <br/>the action that is done.  <br/></p>
<p>An activity done with certain intention is considered as &#8216;good karma&#8217; if it <br/>is selfless and towards the society and nature. And an activity is considered <br/>dharma if it inclines with the sustenance of the society and nature. So, both of <br/>them have the same objective. But what is good karma need not always adhere <br/>to dharma and what is dharma need not always bring good karma.  <br/></p>
<p>The manager in the previous example, when yelling for the first time is <br/>doing his dharma by correcting his employee&#8217;s mistakes, but due to the cruel <br/>intention while doing it, he got bad karma.  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>Example: When a terrorist makes a kid to believe that to achieve world <br/>peace, we should kill some specific people. And if the kid kills those people <br/>with an intent to achieve world peace. She did accumulate good karma. But <br/>because her action wasn&#8217;t inclined to dharma, she will be sent to jail and suffers <br/>due to her action. When she grows up with the same intent of gaining world <br/>peace, knowing the reality of world, she will do the actions which will actually <br/>bring the world peace, and hence automatically adhere to dharma. And due to <br/>these activities, she gets benefited both in the spiritual and physical realms.  <br/></p>
<p>The goal of Moksha is a goal of the spirit, and if not attained by a human <br/>in his lifetime, his spirit will suffer, the same way the natural entity, the human, <br/>will suffer if not achieved dharma.  <br/></p>
<p><b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>A summary <br/></b></p>
<p>Summarizing all the ideas discussed until now, I have started by <br/>describing the structure of knowledge and how all the sensible truths can be <br/>explained as a consequence of the eternal truth. In the sensible philosophy of <br/>life, I have stated the eternal truth which explains the behaviour of all living <br/>creatures which is &#8220;The ultimate goal of any organism is to live&#8221;. The <br/>behaviour of animals is explained using emotions which cause their natural <br/>tendencies, and animals can only act by their natural tendency. While <br/>humans, can act by their experiential tendency and choose their goals of life, <br/>which also, always correspond ultimately to &#8216;to live&#8217; and to &#8216;live better&#8217;. An <br/>in-experienced human may set wrong goals of life which correspond to <br/>&#8216;living worse&#8217; and sometimes even death. Hence the right goals of life which <br/>correspond to better life and are given by the experienced have been <br/>explained. A reasoning is given on why would these goals result in a better <br/>life. While Kama is the goal of achieving the natural tendency, Artha is the <br/>goal of collecting resources for better life. In the pursuit of the collective <br/>goal of Dharma, one has to act such that a human society, or the living entity, <br/>or the entire cosmos sustains. Moksha is explained as the goal of relieving <br/>one&#8217;s spirit from nature. A plausible hypothesis is given on how Karma yoga <br/>works and how it always relates to dharma. This way in the complete <br/>philosophy of life, the sensible philosophy of life is completely reasoned out <br/>and understood why, while the spiritual part is accepted and believed to be <br/>true, together making up the completeness of the philosophy of life.  <br/></p>

<p><b>3. Essence of the philosophy of life &#8211; A self-centric perspective <br/> <br/></b></p>
<p>Standing in front of the great tree of knowledge, I have asked the <br/>question, &#8216;What should I do?&#8217; instead of asking &#8216;What should I do, to get <br/>what I want&#8217;. So, I am expecting an answer which says what should I be <br/>wanting, and craving for, in life. Well, the simple answer is that: do those <br/>things, which I never regret doing. And I just wanted to know what these <br/>things are, what these goals might be, when chosen as life goals, I will never <br/>regret choosing. So, I have started to reason why do people do the things <br/>they do to achieve what goals. And I have found out that whatever we do, we <br/>do it ultimately to live and to live better, one way or the other. But we <br/>humans, forget that most of the time and only see the temporary goal in hand <br/>and do not question what it leads to anyways. Taking the bigger picture of a <br/>sociological perspective, I have seen that life is not an individual entity, but a <br/>shared collective entity of nature, in which an individual is part of. And <br/>behaving in coherence to the shared collective entity of life, the nature, is an <br/>important goal of an individual. Apart from what I can see, what I can reason <br/>and understand, it is important to accept some facts that I don&#8217;t understand <br/>how they could be true, how I could be a spirit craving to get out of this <br/>nature. But only when I believe that and see, can I not regret as a spirit. The <br/>great tree of knowledge can only tell what happens if I do what, and I am the <br/>selecting these goals. <br/> <br/></p>
<p>To generalize the question, remove the &#8216;I&#8217; part and make the question <br/>&#8220;<i>What should one do?</i>&#8221;. What is that one answer for this question which, <br/>which when given to an individual and if he proceeds to do it, will <br/>automatically achieve doing all the purushardhas simultaneously. What <br/>answer can be given to a self-centric individual, who just cares about his <br/>own enjoyment in life. Well, then ask him to be self-centric to the fullest and <br/>the answer is:    <br/></p>
<p> <br/> &#8220;<i>Do those actions such that you will experience the least amount of <br/>suffering</i>, <i>starting from the present moment, till you stop living</i>&#8221;  <br/> <br/>When one self-centric individual sets the goal only to achieve Kama (his <br/>natural tendencies), he gets temporary enjoyment and may suffer bigger <br/>later, when he extends his goal to Artha (to gather resources) to live better, <br/>one may do so only when they earn in accordance to dharma (to sustain <br/>nature), otherwise he will receive a larger loss and suffering later. And when </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>one sets only these three goals and lives without the pursuit of liberation, one <br/>day he becomes the spirit and is out of the body, he will suffer as he is not <br/>liberated, so he has to crave for moksha too. And the &#8216;till you stop living&#8217; is <br/>the moment your soul gets liberated and one can have the eternal peace, <br/>without any suffering anymore.  <br/> So, the answer which can capture the essence of purushardhas, is in a <br/>way, just saying to &#8216;aim for long-term happiness instead of the short-term. <br/>The essence of the philosophy of life is to aim for long-term happiness. <br/>Which is<b> </b>also the essence of all the self-help books. And the knowledge of <br/>what gives that long-term happiness and why, is the philosophy of life.  <b>                                                             <br/></b></p>

<p><b>Some queries on God and Spirituality&#8230;  <br/>1. </b>It is the nature&#8217;s &#8216;quality&#8217; to not to destroy by itself, and to sustain, and <br/></p>
<p>nature exists because it has this quality. It is a human&#8217;s &#8216;capacity&#8217; to live <br/>against and above his nature, and by doing so he attains freedom from the <br/>nature. Are we referring this quality of nature to sustain as the lord <br/>Vishnu and the trait of human to control his senses as lord Shiva. And is it <br/>because people will have a hard time understanding God if described like <br/>this, is that we say they are some super-natural entities Is it because that <br/>god is a very high-grade object, which can be observed after a lot of <br/>reasoning of natural phenomenon, is that we represent them as low-grade <br/>objects, giving them a physical form similar to humans? Or is God really <br/>a super-natural entity belongs to the spiritual realm, that we cannot <br/>observe? <b> <br/> <br/></b></p>
<p>Example: In physics we have a physical quantity called energy. It <br/>cannot be directly observed by the senses, but its effects can only be felt. <br/>Is this the same concept of energy in physics referred as goddess Durga? <br/></p>
<p> <br/>Is God a high-grade object in the sensible realm, or a super-natural <br/></p>
<p>entity in the spiritual realm?  <br/><b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>2. </b>From the philosophy of life in this work, if we remove whatever that is <br/>imposed to be believed as true, if we remove the in-sensible philosophy <br/>of life and also don&#8217;t believe the truth that &#8216;the side of dharma always <br/>wins&#8217;, as it is not reasoned. And if one only believes in the rest of the <br/>sensible philosophy of life, relying only on his senses and patterns made <br/>from them, which is the approach of a pure scientific study, then, there <br/>can exist a particular case where, a man can live for his own benefit, <br/>while not abiding to dharma, and sneak out from the punishment that he <br/>gets, like a thief who robs and hides somewhere enjoying his life, and no <br/>consequences will be felt due to his actions as Karma, a spiritual concept, <br/>doesn&#8217;t work, and live his whole life with the money and die, as there is <br/>no rebirth, he just completed his life in enjoyment while not suffering <br/>even when done adharma and bad karma. <b> <br/></b></p>
<p>If we see the scientific history of humanity and how it evolved, as described <br/>in the book &#8216;sapiens&#8217; for example; people make a set collective belief. A <br/>community can survive as an entity only if all of its members believe them <br/>to be true. If anyone doesn&#8217;t believe them to be true, then he may become <br/>self-centric and destroy the community for his own benefit like the theif </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>  <br/></p>
<p>described in the above example. And such people will live alone having <br/>the benefits and die one day. And because such communities where people <br/>are not convinced with the collective beliefs have perished, only those <br/>communities which made people to believe them through epics and <br/>spiritual teaching have persisted, and ours is one such community, is the <br/>reason we are tending to believe these truths? <b> <br/></b></p>
<p>This hypothesis brings the question that: is the religious knowledge made <br/>to believe so that only when believed does a community exist? And aids <br/>the doubt: whether if the religious knowledge is really true.  <br/><b> <br/></b></p>
<p><b>What I have presented you this&#8230; <br/></b></p>
<p>The knowledge presented in this work is gained in this way:  <br/></p>
<p>1. I will start with a relevant question or a subsequent question to the main <br/>question: &#8216;what should I do&#8217; <br/></p>
<p>2. I will create a set of hypothetical observations, which I feel are possible <br/>to happen in the real world related to the question, like the examples <br/>presented in this work. <br/></p>
<p>3. I will do critical reasoning from these observations, making plausible <br/>hypothesis to get an answer to the question.  <br/></p>
<p>4. If my plausible hypothesis is matching with the already existing <br/>knowledge that I have read or listened, I will also reason why that <br/>knowledge might be true in terms of my fundamentals.   <br/></p>
<p>5. And I will have a final answer which is mostly reasoned by me and <br/>supplemented by some of the sources I have read earlier. And I will move <br/>on to the next subsequent question.  <br/></p>
<p>Now, because this whole knowledge presented in this work is based on my <br/>observations alone, I might be wrong. And I am making hypothetical <br/>examples which may turn out to be not possible in the real world to happen.  <br/></p>
<p>And also, after completing this work and gaining an understanding of the <br/>philosophy of life, I have reviewed some of the older philosophical ideas I <br/>used to have, out of which some turned out to be wrong notions, and some <br/>turned out to be correct notions, but are just a part of the overall philosophy.  <br/></p>
<p>I want you to identify the wrong notions and to also to show where this <br/>philosophy lies in the overall philosophy of life.    <br/></p>
