    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm VNM — an aerospace engineer turned philosopher and writer. 
      I’ve written extensively about life, knowledge, and creativity. 
      This website is my way of sharing those ideas with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to inspire reflection and encourage deeper thinking about 
      the meaning and beauty of existence.
